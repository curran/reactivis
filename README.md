Reusable Interactive D3 Data Visualizations.

This library provides a toolkit of reusable dynamic D3 patterns using [model.js](https://github.com/curran/model).

Authoring dynamic and interactive data visualizations based on existing D3 examples is not straightforward. The examples must be significantly tweaked in order to make the visualizations dynamic (e.g. resizable) and interactive (e.g. adding brushing and linking). A generic flow-based model drawing from functional reactive programming can provide a foundation for authoring dynamic and interactive data visualizations. This approach enables encapsulation of reusable visualization components and straightforward assembly of multiple linked views.
